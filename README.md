# CCC
The bot was created for the Cozmo Clench Competiton for the Techfeat IIT Bombay event. The objective of the game was to grab, hold and carry a block made of styrofoam across the designated arena in the shortest time without letting the block fall from the gripper. 
It was a team event. I was a part of team of 4 members. My job in the team was to make the electronics and electrical part of the robot.
